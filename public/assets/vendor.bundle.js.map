Angular application by explicitly specifying a component to use\r\n * as the root component for your application via the `bootstrap()` method.\r\n *\r\n * ## Simple Example\r\n *\r\n * Assuming this `index.html`:\r\n *\r\n * ```html\r\n * <html>\r\n *   <!-- load Angular script tags here. -->\r\n *   <body>\r\n *     <my-app>loading...</my-app>\r\n *   </body>\r\n * </html>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically `index.html`.\r\n * Unlike Angular 1, Angular 2 does not compile/process providers in `index.html`. This is\r\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n *\r\n * We can use this script code:\r\n *\r\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n *\r\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n *\r\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n *     domain instance.\r\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n *     template into it.\r\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n *     application.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n *\r\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n *\r\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n * to that application.\r\n *\r\n * ## API\r\n *\r\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\r\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\r\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\r\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\r\n *\r\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\r\n */\r\nfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\r\n    core_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new reflection_capabilities_1.ReflectionCapabilities();\r\n    var appProviders = lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ?

equivalent to `'yMMMMEEEEd'` (e.g. Friday, September 3, 2010 for en-US)\r\n *  - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMMd'` (e.g. September 3, 2010)\r\n *  - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMd'` (e.g. Sep 3, 2010 for en-US)\r\n *  - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'yMd'` (e.g. 9/3/2010 for en-US)\r\n *  - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'jms'` (e.g. 12:05:08 PM for en-US)\r\n *  - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'jm'` (e.g. 12:05 PM for en-US)\r\n *\r\n * Timezone of the formatted text will be the local system timezone of the end-users machine.\r\n *\r\n * ### Examples\r\n *\r\n * Assuming

slice:start[:end]\r\n *\r\n * All behavior is based on the expected behavior of the JavaScript API\r\n * Array.prototype.slice() and String.prototype.slice()\r\n *\r\n * Where the input expression is a [List] or [String], and `start` is:\r\n *\r\n * - **a positive integer**: return the item at _start_ index and all items after\r\n * in the list or string expression.\r\n * - **a negative integer**: return the item at _start_ index from the end and all items after\r\n * in the list or string expression.\r\n * - **`|start|` greater than the size of the expression**: return an empty list or string.\r\n * - **`|start|` negative greater than the size of the expression**: return entire list or\r\n * string expression.\r\n *\r\n * and where `end` is:\r\n *\r\n * - **omitted**: return all items until the end of the input\r\n * - **a positive integer**: return all items before _end_ index of the list or string\r\n * expression.\r\n * - **a negative integer**: return all items before _end_ index from the end of the list\r\n * or string expression.\r\n *\r\n * When operating on a [List], the returned list is always a copy even when all\r\n * the elements are being returned.\r\n

on\r\n * an expression's evaluation result.\r\n *\r\n * The result of an expression evaluation is interpreted differently depending on type of\r\n * the expression evaluation result:\r\n * - `string` - all the CSS classes listed in a string (space delimited) are added\r\n * - `Array` - all the CSS classes (Array elements) are added\r\n * - `Object` - each key corresponds to a CSS class name while values are interpreted as expressions\r\n * evaluating to `Boolean`. If a given expression evaluates to `true` a corresponding CSS class\r\n * is added - otherwise it is removed.\r\n *\r\n * While the `NgClass` directive can interpret expressions evaluating to `string`, `Array`\r\n * or `Object`, the `Object`-based version is the most often used and has an advantage of keeping\r\n * all the CSS class names in a template.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live

This has important implications for animations and any stateful\r\n * controls\r\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\r\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\r\n * as user input.\r\n *\r\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\r\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\r\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\r\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\r\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\r\n * be avoided if possible.\r\n *\r\n * # Syntax\r\n *\r\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"#item of items; #i = index\">...</li>`\r\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor #item of items; #i = index\">...</li>`\r\n * - `<template ngFor #item [ngForOf]=\"items\" #i=\"index\"><li>...</li></template>`\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\r\n * example.\r\n */\r\nvar NgFor = (function () {\r\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _templateRef, _iterableDiffers, _cdr) {\r\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\r\n        this._templateRef = _templateRef;\r\n        this._iterableDiffers = _iterableDiffers;\r\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\r\n    }\r\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForOf\", {\r\n        set: function (value) {\r\n            this._ngForOf = value;\r\n            if (lang_1.isBlank(this._differ) && lang_1.isPresent(value)) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    this._differ = this._iterableDiffers.find(value).create(this._cdr, this._ngForTrackBy);\r\n                }\r\n                catch (e) {\r\n                    throw new exceptions_1.BaseException(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + lang_1.getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

view will be treated as a \"category match\", and will only display if exact\r\n * value matches aren't found and the value maps to its category using the `getPluralCategory`\r\n * function provided.\r\n *\r\n * If no matching views are found for a switch expression, inner elements marked\r\n * `[ngPluralCase]=\"other\"` will be displayed.\r\n *\r\n * ```typescript\r\n * class

*/\r\n/*\r\n  This is a limited shim for ShadowDOM css styling.\r\n  https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html#styles\r\n\r\n  The intention here is to support only the styling features which can be\r\n  relatively simply implemented. The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\r\n  Shimmed features:\r\n\r\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n  document level stylesheet.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    :host {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    .foo {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n  this feature.\r\n\r\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\r\n  div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n  x-foo div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    div[x-foo] {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n  selector added to them manually.\r\n\r\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\r\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\r\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\r\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <content></content>\r\n\r\n  could become:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\r\n      <content></content>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\r\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\r\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\r\n*/\r\nvar ShadowCss = (function () {\r\n    function ShadowCss() {\r\n        this.strictStyling = true;\r\n    }\r\n    /*\r\n    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.

a navigation.\r\n *\r\n * <aside class=\"is-right\">\r\n * Note that unlike other lifecycle hooks, this one uses an annotation rather than an interface.\r\n * This is because the `CanActivate` function is called before the component is instantiated.\r\n * </aside>\r\n *\r\n * The `CanActivate` hook is called with two {@link ComponentInstruction}s as parameters, the first\r\n * representing the current route being navigated to, and the second parameter representing the\r\n * previous route or `null`.\r\n *\r\n * ```typescript\r\n * @CanActivate((next, prev) => boolean | Promise<boolean>)\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * If `CanActivate` returns or resolves to `false`, the navigation is cancelled.\r\n * If `CanActivate` throws or rejects, the navigation is also cancelled.\r\n * If `CanActivate` returns or resolves to `true`, navigation continues, the component is\r\n * instantiated, and the {@link OnActivate} hook of that component is called if implemented.\r\n *\r\n * ###
